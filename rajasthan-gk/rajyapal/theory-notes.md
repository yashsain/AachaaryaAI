# राज्यपाल (Governor of Rajasthan)

## Constitutional Basis

**Article 153**: Each state shall have a Governor. The **7th Constitutional Amendment (1956)** provided that one person could serve as Governor of two or more states.

The Governor stands at the apex of a state's executive, though actual power resides with the [state cabinet](https://www.rajasthangyan.com/rajasthan?nid=75). **All executive powers are vested in the Governor** (**Article 154**), exercised per constitutional rules.

## Appointment and Tenure

The **President appoints the Governor** on the recommendation of the Union cabinet **under Article 155**. The Governor's appointment framework was borrowed from Canada.

The **Sarkaria Commission (1983)** made key recommendations:
- The Chief Minister should be consulted before appointment
- Election losers should not be appointed as Governor
- The Governor should not be appointed in their home state

Generally, the Governor's term is **5 years**, but in practice, they serve **at the President's pleasure** (**Article 156**). The Constitution lacks explicit removal provisions, though the post remains independent and constitutional.

The Governor becomes chief of both state and government. The Governor's effectiveness depends on their approach to the office.

The Governor's role becomes critical when elected government, Chief Minister, or cabinet faces constitutional crisis. Decision-making in disputed situations is difficult and important.

### 4. As Actual Administrator

## Cabinet-Governor Relations

The Cabinet-Governor relationship mirrors the Central Cabinet-President relationship. **Key difference**: The President lacks discretionary powers; the Governor has them (**Article 163**).

The Governor receives help and advice from a cabinet headed by the Chief Minister. No inquiry can examine the advice given. Where the Governor acts discretionarily, they need not follow cabinet counsel. India's parliamentary system makes the cabinet collectively responsible to the Assembly; the Governor generally must follow their advice.

The Governor structures the cabinet, appoints its members and the Chief Minister (leader of the Assembly's majority party).
