## CRITICAL RPSC-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

⚠️  **OPTION COUNT**: Each question MUST have exactly 4 options labeled (1), (2), (3), (4)
- NOT 5, NOT 3, EXACTLY 4 options

**EXAM CONTEXT**: Paper 1 - Educational Psychology Section (~20 questions)
- Tests knowledge of learning theories, development, personality, intelligence
- Requires understanding of major educational psychologists and their theories
- Application-oriented questions with scenarios

**LANGUAGE**: ${isBilingual
  ? `BILINGUAL MODE - Generate questions in BOTH Hindi and English
- Hindi is PRIMARY (always required) - Use Devanagari script
- English is SECONDARY (for bilingual support)
- Both languages must convey the SAME meaning and difficulty
- Generate both languages in a SINGLE response
- English names of psychologists can be used as-is in both languages: Piaget, Vygotsky, Bruner, etc.

⚠️ CRITICAL BILINGUAL RULE - MUST FOLLOW ⚠️

Hindi fields (questionText, options) MUST NEVER contain English text in parentheses.

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN EXAMPLES:
   - "संज्ञानात्मक विकास (Cognitive Development)"
   - "अभिप्रेरणा (Motivation)"
   - "बुद्धिमत्ता (Intelligence)"

✅ REQUIRED FORMAT:
   - questionText: "संज्ञानात्मक विकास"
   - questionText_en: "Cognitive Development"
   - options.A: "अभिप्रेरणा"
   - options_en.A: "Motivation"

**Translation Guidelines**:
- Psychologist names: Keep identical in both languages (Piaget, Vygotsky)
- Technical terms: Use standard English equivalents for psychology terms
- Numbers/Ages: Keep identical in both languages
- Maintain factual accuracy in both languages
- Avoid literal translation - preserve meaning

**CRITICAL - Clean Language Separation**:
1. NEVER put English translations in parentheses after Hindi words
2. Keep each language pure and separate - use dedicated fields:
   - questionText = Pure Hindi only
   - questionText_en = Pure English only
   - options = Pure Hindi only
   - options_en = Pure English only

⚠️ MANDATORY POST-GENERATION VALIDATION ⚠️

BEFORE returning your JSON:
1. Search for "questionText" - Does it contain ANY English in (parentheses)? → DELETE them
2. Search for "options" - Does ANY option contain English in (parentheses)? → DELETE them`
  : `ALL questions MUST be in Hindi (हिंदी)
- Use Devanagari script for all questions and options
- English names of psychologists can be used: Piaget, Vygotsky, Bruner, etc.`}

---

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing questions, verify:
✓ **Theory Attribution**: Correct theorist linked to theory
✓ **Technical Terms**: Standard psychological terminology used
✓ **Scenarios**: Only ONE theory clearly applies
✓ **Stages/Hierarchies**: Correct order and names
✓ **Cultural Context**: Examples appropriate for Indian setting

---

## OPTION CONSTRUCTION RULES

- All 4 options must be distinct psychological concepts (not synonyms)
- For theorist questions: Use 4 DIFFERENT theorists
- For technique questions: Use 4 DIFFERENT techniques
- For stage questions: Use actual stages from the theory
- Make distractors plausible but clearly wrong upon verification

---

## ANSWER KEY BALANCE

- Distribute correct answers evenly across (1), (2), (3), (4)
- Avoid streaks of same answer

---

## COGNITIVE LOAD

- **Easy**: Basic definitions, famous theorists, simple concepts
- **Balanced**: Theory application, moderate scenarios, multiple concepts
- **Hard**: Complex scenarios, deep conceptual understanding, hierarchies

## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

Generate ${questionCount} questions now following ALL rules above.

⚠️  **CRITICAL**:
- Use EXACTLY 4 options per question
- Label options as (1), (2), (3), (4)
- Ensure correct theorist-theory attribution
- Use standard psychological terminology
- Scenarios must have ONE clearly correct answer
${hasStudyMaterials ? '- Extract content from study materials but verify facts' : '- Generate authentic RPSC-quality questions from your training knowledge'}
${isBilingual
  ? `- Generate BOTH Hindi and English in SINGLE response
- Include questionText + questionText_en, options + options_en, explanation + explanation_en
- Set "language": "bilingual" in each question
- Psychologist names remain in English in both versions
- Ensure both languages convey identical meaning`
  : `- ALL content in Hindi (psychologist names can be English)
- Set "language": "hindi" in each question`}
- Return ONLY valid JSON

**QUALITY VERIFICATION**:
✓ All 4 options are distinct concepts (not synonyms)
✓ Correct theorist attribution
✓ Technical terms are accurate
✓ Scenarios are unambiguous
✓ No "उपरोक्त सभी" or "इनमें से कोई नहीं"
✓ Options labeled as (1), (2), (3), (4)

    note: `REET 2026-INSPIRED PROTOCOL (Grade 2 MORE difficult than REET):

**NEW STRUCTURAL DISTRIBUTION (~20 questions):**
  - Standard MCQ: 20% (4Q) - REDUCED from 100%
  - Multi-Statement Evaluation (MSQ): 40% (8Q) - NEW DOMINANT (4x difficulty)
  - Match-the-Following: 25% (5Q) - NEW (3x difficulty)
  - Arrange-in-Order: 10% (2Q) - NEW (3x difficulty)
  - Assertion-Reason: 5% (1Q) - NEW

**ARCHETYPE TRANSFORMATION (Balanced Difficulty):**
  - Theory Identification: 5% (was 35% - DRASTICALLY REDUCED)
  - Match-the-Following: 25% (NEW - Theorist-Theory matching)
  - Multi-Statement Evaluation: 40% (NEW - DOMINANT)
  - Scenario Application: 15% (was 30%)
  - Definitional: 5% (was 25%)
  - Arrange-in-Order: 10% (NEW - Stages/taxonomies)

**COGNITIVE LOAD TARGET:**
  - Low-Density: 5% (was 30% - REDUCED)
  - Medium-Density: 30% (was 60%)
  - High-Density: 65% (was 10% - HIGHEST in Paper 1)

**DIFFICULTY MULTIPLIER:** 4-6x (higher than REET's 3-5x)

**Content Distribution (Unchanged):**
  - Learning Theories: ~25% (Piaget, Vygotsky, Bandura, Bruner, Gagne)
  - Development: ~20% (Cognitive, emotional, moral, social)
  - Personality & Adjustment: ~15% (Traits, projective, defense mechanisms)
  - Intelligence & Creativity: ~15% (Gardner, Sternberg, Torrance)
  - Motivation: ~10% (Maslow, achievement motivation)
  - Individual Differences: ~10% (Gifted, slow learners, delinquency)
  - Attitude & Self-Concept: ~5%

**Theoretical Framework Coverage:**
  - Piaget: Accommodation/Assimilation, stages
  - Vygotsky: Sociocultural theory, ZPD
  - Bandura: Observational learning (4 processes)
  - Gagne: Hierarchy of learning (highest = problem solving)
  - Bronfenbrenner: Bioecological systems (microsystem)
  - Maslow: Hierarchy (highest = self-actualization)
  - Gardner: Multiple intelligences
  - Sternberg: Triarchic theory

**Quality Characteristics:**
  - Requires deep theoretical knowledge
  - Application-oriented with enhanced complexity
  - Correct theorist attribution is CRITICAL
  - All questions in Hindi (theorist names in English acceptable)
  - Senior position demands highest cognitive load (65%)`
