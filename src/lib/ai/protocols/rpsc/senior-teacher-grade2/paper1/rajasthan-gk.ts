## CRITICAL RPSC-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

⚠️  **OPTION COUNT**: Each question MUST have exactly 4 options labeled (1), (2), (3), (4)
- NOT 5, NOT 3, EXACTLY 4 options - RPSC uses 4-option MCQ format

**EXAM CONTEXT**: Paper 1 (Common for ALL Senior Teacher Grade II candidates)
- Every candidate takes Paper 1 regardless of subject specialization
- Tests comprehensive knowledge of Rajasthan geography, history, culture

**LANGUAGE**: ${isBilingual
  ? `BILINGUAL MODE - Generate questions in BOTH Hindi and English
- Hindi is PRIMARY (always required) - Use Devanagari script
- English is SECONDARY (for bilingual support)
- Both languages must convey the SAME meaning and difficulty
- Generate both languages in a SINGLE response

⚠️ CRITICAL BILINGUAL RULE - MUST FOLLOW ⚠️

Hindi fields (questionText, options) MUST NEVER contain English text in parentheses.

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN EXAMPLES:
   - "जैसलमेर (Jaisalmer)"
   - "मृत्युदंड (Death Sentence) के मामले में..."
   - "राजस्थान की राजधानी (Capital of Rajasthan)"

✅ REQUIRED FORMAT:
   - questionText: "जैसलमेर"
   - questionText_en: "Jaisalmer"
   - options.A: "मृत्युदंड"
   - options_en.A: "Death Sentence"

**Translation Guidelines**:
- Proper nouns: Transliterate correctly (जैसलमेर → Jaisalmer, महाराणा प्रताप → Maharana Pratap)
- Technical terms: Use standard English equivalents
- Cultural terms: Transliterate with context preservation
- Numbers/Dates: Keep identical in both languages
- Do NOT translate names of places, people, schemes - transliterate only
- Maintain factual accuracy and question difficulty in both languages
- Avoid literal word-by-word translation - preserve meaning and context

**CRITICAL - Clean Language Separation**:
1. NEVER put English translations in parentheses after Hindi words
2. NEVER put Hindi/Sanskrit transliterations in parentheses after English words
3. Keep each language pure and separate - use the dedicated fields:
   - questionText = Pure Hindi only
   - questionText_en = Pure English only
   - options = Pure Hindi only
   - options_en = Pure English only

⚠️ MANDATORY POST-GENERATION VALIDATION ⚠️

BEFORE returning your JSON:
1. Search for "questionText" - Does it contain ANY English words in (parentheses)? → DELETE them
2. Search for "options" - Does ANY option contain English in (parentheses)? → DELETE them
3. Examples of fixes:
   - FIND: "मृत्युदंड (Death Sentence)" → FIX TO: "मृत्युदंड"
   - FIND: "राजस्थान की राजधानी (Capital)" → FIX TO: "राजस्थान की राजधानी"`
  : `ALL questions MUST be in Hindi (हिंदी)
- Use Devanagari script for all questions and options
- Primary language for RPSC exam in Rajasthan is Hindi`}

## PRE-RETURN VALIDATION PROCEDURE (MANDATORY)

⚠️ **BEFORE RETURNING YOUR JSON OUTPUT, YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS 5-STEP VALIDATION**:

**STEP 1: NULL/UNDEFINED CHECK**
- Scan your entire JSON output for the word "null" - Count: ___
- If count > 0: STOP, identify which field is null, FIX IT with a valid value
- Scan for "undefined" - Count: ___
- If count > 0: STOP, FIX IT immediately

**STEP 2: EMPTY STRING CHECK**
- Check each questionText - Is it empty or less than 10 characters? YES/NO: ___
- If YES: STOP, write a proper question (minimum 10 characters)
- Check each option["1"], ["2"], ["3"], ["4"] - Any empty or less than 2 characters? YES/NO: ___
- If YES: STOP, write proper option text
- Check each explanation - Is it empty or less than 20 characters? YES/NO: ___
- If YES: STOP, write detailed explanation

**STEP 3: OPTION COUNT VERIFICATION**
- Count option keys in each question - Expected: 4, Actual: ___
- Are all keys exactly "1", "2", "3", "4"? YES/NO: ___
- If NO: STOP, fix the option keys

**STEP 4: CORRECTANSWER VALIDATION**
- Check each correctAnswer value - Is it one of "1", "2", "3", "4" (string)? YES/NO: ___
- If NO: STOP, fix the correctAnswer (must be string "1", "2", "3", or "4")

**STEP 5: DUPLICATE OPTIONS CHECK**
- For each question, compare all 4 options - Are they all textually different? YES/NO: ___
- If NO: STOP, rewrite duplicate options to be unique

**VALIDATION COMPLETE**: Only proceed to return JSON if ALL checks passed.

## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

Generate ${questionCount} questions now following ALL rules above.

⚠️  **CRITICAL**:
- Use EXACTLY 4 options per question (NOT 5)
- Label options as (1), (2), (3), (4)
- Factual accuracy for Rajasthan content is MANDATORY
${hasStudyMaterials ? '- Extract content from study materials but verify facts' : '- Generate authentic RPSC-quality questions from your training knowledge'}
- NO meta-references
${isBilingual
  ? `- Generate BOTH Hindi and English in SINGLE response
- Include questionText + questionText_en, options + options_en, explanation + explanation_en
- Set "language": "bilingual" in each question
- Ensure both languages convey identical meaning and difficulty`
  : `- ALL content in Hindi (Devanagari script)
- Set "language": "hindi" in each question`}
- Return ONLY valid JSON

**QUALITY VERIFICATION** (check before returning):
