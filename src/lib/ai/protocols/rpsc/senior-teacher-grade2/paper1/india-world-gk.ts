## ⚠️ CRITICAL QUALITY STANDARDS - READ CAREFULLY

This is a COMPETITIVE GOVERNMENT EXAM for SENIOR TEACHER positions. Questions MUST be:
- **Academically rigorous** - test deep India & World GK knowledge, not trivial facts
- **Professionally appropriate** - suitable for evaluating experienced educators
- **Discriminating** - separate strong candidates from weak ones
- **Complex enough** to challenge senior-level candidates
- **NOT simplistic** - avoid obvious/trivial GK that insult candidate intelligence
- **NOT generic** - use specific details from Indian Polity, Geography, History, Economy
- **NCERT-plus level** - go beyond basic NCERT to include advanced topics

**FORBIDDEN QUALITY FAILURES:**
❌ Overly simple GK that any layperson could answer
❌ Generic questions without specific depth (dates, names, facts, numbers)
❌ Questions with obvious answers that don't test real knowledge
❌ Lazy statement combinations that are all obviously true/false
❌ Predictable matching patterns that require no thinking
❌ Surface-level recall when deeper analysis is possible
❌ Outdated information contradicting current constitutional/geographical facts

**REQUIRED QUALITY MARKERS:**
✅ Specific details (dates, Article numbers, names, places, numbers) from India GK
✅ Nuanced distinctions requiring careful study of Polity, Geography, History
✅ Integration of multiple knowledge domains (e.g., Geography + Economy + History)
✅ Critical thinking and analytical reasoning about India & World affairs
✅ Professional-grade difficulty appropriate for senior educators
✅ NCERT-based but with advanced/contemporary extensions

## STRUCTURAL FORMAT (REET 2026-Inspired - 4 Format Types)

**FORMAT 1: STANDARD 4-OPTION MCQ (17% of questions):**
\`\`\`
प्रश्न का हिंदी पाठ यहां?
(1) पहला विकल्प
(2) दूसरा विकल्प
(3) तीसरा विकल्प
(4) चौथा विकल्प
\`\`\`
Example: भारत में व्यवसाय प्रत्याशा सूचकांक (BEI) कौन सा संगठन प्रकाशित करता है? (1) वाणिज्य मंत्रालय (2) RBI (3) FICCI (4) नीति आयोग

**FORMAT 2: MULTI-STATEMENT EVALUATION (MSQ) (40% of questions - DOMINANT):**
\`\`\`
भारतीय संविधान के बारे में निम्नलिखित कथनों पर विचार कीजिए:
(a) अनुच्छेद 21 में निजता का अधिकार शामिल है
(b) अनुच्छेद 21-A शिक्षा का अधिकार प्रदान करता है
(c) मूल संविधान में 11 मूल कर्तव्य थे
(d) अनुच्छेद 19(1)(a) में जानने का अधिकार शामिल है
उपरोक्त में से कौन से कथन सही हैं?
(1) केवल (a) और (b)
(2) केवल (a), (b) और (d)
(3) केवल (b) और (c)
(4) केवल (a), (c) और (d)
\`\`\`
**MSQ GENERATION RULES:**
- Present 4-5 statements (use 5 for hard difficulty)
- Each statement must be independently verifiable
- Options show different combinations of true statements
- ALL options must be grammatically parallel: "केवल (a) और (b)" format
- Ensure only ONE option contains the correct combination

**⚠️ CRITICAL MSQ QUALITY RULE - ZERO TOLERANCE:**
**"ALL CORRECT" ANSWERS BANNED**: NEVER make MSQ questions where all statements are correct
- ❌ ZERO TOLERANCE: Do NOT make even 1 MSQ question with all options (a), (b), (c), (d) correct
- ✅ EVERY MSQ MUST have MIX of true/false statements requiring discrimination
- Create realistic false statements using: common misconceptions, partial truths, reversed facts, outdated data
- MAKE IT CHALLENGING - test actual knowledge, not just "select all correct" laziness
- Example distribution for 10 MSQ: 3 correct (a,b), 2 correct (a,c), 3 correct (b,d), 2 correct (a,b,c) - ZERO "all correct"
- **FORBIDDEN LAZINESS**: Do NOT make all statements obviously true - this is NOT a quality question

**FORMAT 3: MATCH-THE-FOLLOWING (20% of questions):**
\`\`\`
सूची-I को सूची-II से सुमेलित कीजिए:
सूची-I (अधिकार)         सूची-II (अनुच्छेद)

सही विकल्प चुनिए:
(1) A-i, B-ii, C-iii, D-iv
(2) A-iii, B-ii, C-iv, D-i
(3) A-iv, B-ii, C-iii, D-i
(4) A-i, B-iii, C-ii, D-iv
\`\`\`
**MATCHING GENERATION RULES:**
- Use 4 pairs (occasionally 5 for hard difficulty)
- Ensure all pairings are factually accurate
- Create plausible distractor options by mixing correct pairings
- All-or-nothing: entire pattern must match correctly

**⚠️ CRITICAL MATCH QUALITY RULE - RANDOMIZATION ENFORCEMENT:**
**LAZY SEQUENTIAL MATCHING FORBIDDEN**: NEVER make A-i, B-ii, C-iii, D-iv the correct answer
- This is LAZY question making and provides ZERO challenge
- Correct answer MUST have randomized matching (e.g., A-iii, B-i, C-iv, D-ii)
- Minimum 2 items must be "crossed" (not sequential) - prefer 3-4 crossed items
- Examples of ACCEPTABLE patterns: A-ii, B-iv, C-i, D-iii OR A-iii, B-i, C-iv, D-ii
- Example of FORBIDDEN pattern: A-i, B-ii, C-iii, D-iv (this will be REJECTED)
- **QUALITY TEST**: If a student can guess without reading List-II, the question is TOO EASY

**FORMAT 4: ARRANGE-IN-ORDER (23% of questions):**
\`\`\`
निम्नलिखित महाद्वीपों को जनसंख्या के अवरोही क्रम (सर्वाधिक से न्यूनतम) में व्यवस्थित कीजिए:
A. अफ्रीका
B. यूरोप
C. उत्तरी अमेरिका
D. दक्षिण अमेरिका
सही क्रम चुनिए:
(1) A-B-C-D
(2) A-C-D-B
(3) A-C-B-D
(4) C-A-B-D
\`\`\`
**ARRANGE GENERATION RULES:**
- Use 4 items (occasionally 5 for hard difficulty)
- Types: Chronological, Numerical (ascending/descending), Spatial (west→east, north→south)
- Ensure items have clear ordering criteria
- Create distractor sequences with partial correctness

**⚠️ CRITICAL ARRANGE QUALITY RULE - RANDOMIZATION ENFORCEMENT:**
**LAZY SEQUENTIAL ORDERING FORBIDDEN**: NEVER make A-B-C-D the correct answer
- This is LAZY question making - items are already in correct order, providing ZERO challenge
- Correct answer MUST scramble the order (e.g., B-D-A-C, D-A-C-B, C-A-D-B)
- Present items in RANDOM/SHUFFLED order initially, NOT in their natural sequence
- Examples of ACCEPTABLE patterns: B-D-A-C, D-C-B-A, C-A-D-B, B-A-D-C
- Example of FORBIDDEN pattern: A-B-C-D (this will be REJECTED)
- **QUALITY TEST**: If the items are already presented in correct chronological/numerical/spatial order, you are being LAZY
- Shuffle items deliberately so students must think about the correct sequence

## MANDATORY SELF-VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**YOU MUST MENTALLY VERIFY EACH ITEM BEFORE GENERATING EACH QUESTION:**

### Data Integrity Validation (CRITICAL):
1. ✓ questionNumber is a positive integer (not null, not undefined, not 0)
2. ✓ questionText is a non-empty string with minimum 10 characters (not null, not undefined, not "")
3. ✓ options object exists and is not null/undefined
4. ✓ options has EXACTLY 4 keys: "1", "2", "3", "4" (not A/B/C/D, not 0-indexed)
5. ✓ options["1"] is a non-empty string with minimum 2 characters
6. ✓ options["2"] is a non-empty string with minimum 2 characters
7. ✓ options["3"] is a non-empty string with minimum 2 characters
8. ✓ options["4"] is a non-empty string with minimum 2 characters
9. ✓ correctAnswer is one of "1", "2", "3", "4" (string format, not number)
10. ✓ explanation is a non-empty string with minimum 20 characters (not null, not undefined)

### Content Quality Validation:
11. ✓ All 4 options are textually DIFFERENT (no duplicates)

17. ✓ archetype matches the question type actually generated
18. ✓ structuralForm matches the format actually used
19. ✓ cognitiveLoad is appropriate for question complexity
20. ✓ difficulty is set correctly

### Bilingual Validation (if isBilingual=true):
21. ✓ questionText_en exists and is non-empty (if bilingual mode)
22. ✓ options_en object exists with all 4 keys (if bilingual mode)
23. ✓ explanation_en exists and is non-empty (if bilingual mode)
24. ✓ Hindi fields contain NO English words in parentheses

30. ✓ Archetype is NOT one of forbidden values (assertionReason, comparative, statementValidation, matching, sequencing)

---

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing questions, verify:
✓ **Polity**: Article numbers are correct, provisions are accurate
✓ **Geography**: Physical features, locations are accurate
✓ **History**: Dates, events, personalities are correct
✓ **Economy**: Latest data, rankings are current
✓ **International**: Organization memberships, positions are accurate
✓ **NO Controversial Politics**: Stick to factual, non-partisan content

---

## OPTION CONSTRUCTION RULES

- All 4 options must be plausible
- For Article questions: Use actual article numbers
- For geography: Use actual locations/features
- For history: Use actual dates/events/persons
- For economy: Use realistic numbers/rankings
- Make distractors plausible but clearly wrong upon verification

---

## ANSWER KEY BALANCE

- Distribute correct answers evenly across (1), (2), (3), (4)
- Avoid streaks of same answer

---

## COGNITIVE LOAD

- **Easy**: NCERT-level basic facts
- **Balanced**: Specific articles, moderate geography, basic economy
- **Hard**: Obscure constitutional provisions, complex statement validation, detailed rankings
