# NEET Biology Paper Generation Protocol

---

## 1. QUESTION ARCHETYPE DISTRIBUTION

For N total questions, distribute cognitive roles within these mandatory ranges:

- **Direct Recall:** 58-65%
  - Single-concept factual knowledge, definitions, terminology from NCERT

- **Direct Application:** 10-15%
  - Single-step application of concepts to straightforward scenarios

- **Integrative/Multi-concept:** 8-15%
  - Combine two or more concepts requiring connections across topics

- **Conceptual Discriminator:** 5-13%
  - Deep conceptual understanding to separate subtle distinctions

- **Exception/Outlier Logic:** 8-18%
  - Identify exceptions to general rules, special cases, outliers

**RULE:** Every question must fall into exactly one category. Percentages must sum to 100%.

---

## 2. STRUCTURAL FORMS DISTRIBUTION

For N total questions, distribute formats within these mandatory ranges:

- **Standard 4-Option MCQ:** 43-62%
  - Traditional single stem with 4 options

- **Match-the-Following:** 9-32%
  - Always 4×4 matrix with coded options

- **Assertion-Reason:** 1-11%
  - Two statements with 4 options about truth and linkage

- **Two-Statement Evaluation:** 0-14%
  - Multiple statements with combination-based options

- **Multi-Statement Combination:** 7-12%
  - Select correct group from coded statement combinations

- **Negative Phrasing:** 8-18%
  - "Which is NOT correct", "incorrect statement" format

**RULE:** Every question must use exactly one structural form. Percentages must sum to 100%.

---

## 3. COGNITIVE LOAD MANAGEMENT

**Word Count:**
- Average: 23-28 words per question
- Typical range: 15-40 words
- Maximum: 70-85 words

**Decision Count:**
- Average: 1.6-2.0 decisions per question

**Density Distribution:**
- **Low-density** (<20 words, 1 decision): ~40%
- **Medium-density** (20-50 words, 1-2 decisions): ~48%
- **High-density** (>50 words OR 3+ decisions): 11-16%

**FROZEN RULE - Maximum Consecutive High-Load:**
- NEVER place more than 2 high-density questions consecutively
- After any 2 consecutive high-load questions, MUST place at least 1 low-load question
- Zero violations allowed

**Load Progression Pattern:**
- **First 10% of questions:** Warm-up zone - use low-density, direct recall only
- **Middle 80% of questions:** Oscillating pattern - alternate high-load clusters with breathers
- **Last 10% of questions:** Maintain challenge - no cooldown, keep difficulty consistent

---

## 4. DISCRIMINATOR QUESTIONS

**Quantity:** 14-22% of total questions

**Distribution:** Spread evenly throughout paper, avoid clustering

**Requirement:** Each discriminator MUST exploit one specific misconception or reasoning failure:

- Terminology precision traps
- Process mechanism misconceptions
- Similar concept discrimination
- Exception to general rules
- Structural/locational precision requirements
- Functional misattribution
- Reversal traps (swapped facts/structures)

**Distractor Quality:** All 3 wrong options must be plausible to students with partial understanding

---

## 5. LANGUAGE & PHRASING RULES

**Sentence Structure:**
- Prefer concise over verbose
- Single-sentence stems for 70% of direct recall questions
- Maximum complexity: one complex sentence OR two moderate sentences

**NCERT Fidelity (Mandatory Distribution):**
- 58-62% strict NCERT wording (exact phrases from textbook)
- 33-37% moderate paraphrasing (same concepts, different wording)
- Maximum 5% loose paraphrasing (application-based)

**Common Phrasing Patterns (Approximate Usage):**
- "Which of the following...": ~29%
- "The incorrect statement is..." / "Which is NOT...": 8-18%
- "Match the following...": as needed for Match questions
- "Choose the correct answer from the options given below": standard for Match questions
- "In the light of the above statements, choose...": standard for Assertion-Reason

**FROZEN PROHIBITIONS - NEVER use:**
- "Always" or "Never" in question stems
- Double negatives
- Ambiguous pronouns without clear referents
- Vague quantifiers without scientific context (use "usually", "generally", "often" only when scientifically accurate, <3% of questions)

---

## 6. OPTION CONSTRUCTION RULES

**Length Homogeneity:**
- 87% of questions: all 4 options approximately equal length
- 11% of questions: acceptable paired structure (2 short + 2 long)
- Maximum 2% variable length

**Visual Balance:**
- 98% of questions must be visually balanced
- All 4 options must use same grammatical structure
- NEVER create lopsided options (1 massive + 3 tiny)

**Option Echo (Word Repetition):**
- 80% of questions: LOW echo - options introduce new information, minimal stem repetition
- 18% of questions: MEDIUM echo - some overlap acceptable
- Maximum 2% high echo

**Mutual Exclusivity:**
- All 4 options must be mutually exclusive (no overlap in meaning)
- Each option must represent a distinct answer

**FROZEN PROHIBITIONS - NEVER include:**
- "None of the above"
- "All of the above"
- "Both A and B" (unless scientifically necessary for multi-statement questions)
- Subset inclusion (Option A completely contained in Option B)

---

## 7. DISTRACTOR CONSTRUCTION

**Archetype Distribution (for all wrong options):**
- **Partially Correct** (true in different context): ~15%
- **Common Misconception:** ~27%
- **Related but Irrelevant Concept:** ~26%
- **Plausible Fabrication:** ~5% (use sparingly, prefer factually grounded)
- **Correct Fact, Wrong Application:** ~22%
- **Reversal/Precision Trap:** ~10%

**Quality Standards:**
- Homogeneity: 92-94% of questions must have distractors similar in length/complexity to correct answer
- Symmetry: 96-98% of questions must have all 4 options in same grammatical form
- No quality gradient: distractor sophistication must be high from first to last question

---

## 8. MATCH-THE-FOLLOWING RULES

**Structure:**
- Always use 4×4 matrix format
- Always provide coded options (e.g., A-III, B-I, C-IV, D-II)
- Always end with "Choose the correct answer from the options given below"

**Solvability Threshold:**
- Average solvability: 1.4-1.7 steps
- 29-71% of Match questions: 1-step solvable (knowing one element allows elimination)
- 33-71% of Match questions: 2-step solvable (knowing two elements required)

**FROZEN RULE:**
- NEVER create All-step Match questions (requiring knowledge of all 4 pairs with no elimination path)
- Zero violations allowed

---

## 9. ASSERTION-REASON RULES

**Structure (Use this exact 4-option format):**
1. Both Assertion and Reason are true, Reason is correct explanation of Assertion
2. Both Assertion and Reason are true, Reason is NOT correct explanation of Assertion
3. Assertion is true, Reason is false
4. Assertion is false, Reason is true

**Standard Phrasing:**
- Always provide: "Assertion (A):" followed by statement
- Always provide: "Reason (R):" followed by statement
- Always end with: "In the light of the above statements, choose the correct answer..."

**Cognitive Load:**
- Counts as 3 decisions (Assertion truth + Reason truth + Linkage)
- Consider as high-density question

---

## 10. TWO-STATEMENT EVALUATION RULES

**Structure:**
- Provide Statement I and Statement II
- Ask to identify if each is TRUE or FALSE
- Use 4-option format showing all truth combinations

**Common Discriminator Tactics:**
- Include FALSE statements representing common misconceptions
- Use reversal traps (swapped facts between statements)

---

## 11. MULTI-STATEMENT COMBINATION RULES

**Structure:**
- Provide 4-5 statements labeled A, B, C, D, E
- Ask to identify correct statements
- Provide 4 coded options showing different combinations

**Common Discriminator Tactics:**
- Include 2-3 false statements among the set
- Use terminology precision traps
- Use partially correct statements (true in different context)

---

## 12. ARCHETYPE-FORM CO-OCCURRENCE RULES

**Mandatory Pairings:**
- Integrative/Multi-concept archetype → MUST use Multi-statement combination OR Assertion-Reason format (98% correlation required)

**Strong Pairings:**
- Exception/Outlier logic archetype → STRONGLY prefer Negative phrasing format (95% correlation)
- Match-the-Following format → STRONGLY prefer Direct Recall archetype content (89% correlation)

---

## 13. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

These patterns have zero tolerance - NO violations allowed:

**Question Types - NEVER create:**
- Open-ended questions
- Opinion-based questions
- Cross-subject questions (Biology + Chemistry/Physics)
- Calculation-heavy numerical problems (simple recall-based calculations acceptable)

**Phrasing - NEVER use:**
- "Always" or "Never" in stems
- Double negatives
- Ambiguous pronouns

**Options - NEVER include:**
- "None of the above"
- "All of the above"
- Subset inclusion traps (A ⊂ B)
- Lopsided visual weight (1 massive + 3 tiny)
- Non-mutually exclusive options

**Cognitive Load - NEVER violate:**
- More than 2 consecutive high-density questions

**Match Questions - NEVER create:**
- All-step solvability (must know all 4 pairs with no elimination path)
- Non-4×4 matrices
- Options without coded format

---

## 14. ANSWER KEY DISTRIBUTION

For N questions, ensure approximately equal distribution:
- Option A as correct answer: 23-27%
- Option B as correct answer: 23-27%
- Option C as correct answer: 23-27%
- Option D as correct answer: 23-27%

**Avoid:** More than 3 consecutive questions with same correct answer

---

## 15. GENERATION WORKFLOW

**Step 1: Calculate Distribution**
- For N questions, calculate exact counts for each archetype within ranges
- Calculate exact counts for each structural form within ranges
- Verify all percentages sum to 100%

**Step 2: Apply Co-occurrence Rules**
- Map Integrative/Multi-concept → Multi-statement/Assertion-Reason formats
- Map Exception/Outlier → Negative phrasing format
- Map Match-the-Following → Direct Recall content

**Step 3: Distribute Cognitive Load**
- Place warm-up questions (low-density, direct recall) in first 10%
- Distribute high-load questions with mandatory breathers after every 2 consecutive
- Verify max-2-consecutive rule throughout

**Step 4: Distribute Discriminators**
- Select 14-22% of questions as discriminators
- Distribute evenly throughout paper
- Ensure each exploits specific misconception

**Step 5: Generate Questions**
- Follow NCERT fidelity requirements (58-62% strict)
- Apply language and phrasing rules
- Construct options with proper homogeneity
- Build distractors using specified archetypes

**Step 6: Validation**
- Verify no prohibited patterns
- Check cognitive load distribution
